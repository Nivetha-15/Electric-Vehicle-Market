Introduction:
        The electric vehicle (EV) market has experienced rapid growth in recent years, driven by advancements in technology, increasing environmental concerns, and supportive government policies. EVs, which include both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), are reshaping the global automotive industry and paving the way for a sustainable future.
Global Market   Size and Growth:
The global EV market was valued at over $200 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 20% through 2030.Key growth regions include North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, with China leading in EV production and sales. Increasing consumer awareness of environmental issues and lower operating costs of EVs are driving adoption. Government incentives, including tax credits, subsidies, and exemptions from tolls, have played a critical role in accelerating EV purchases. 
Improvements in battery technology, such as higher energy densities and reduced costs, are making EVs more affordable and practical. The development of faster charging infrastructure is addressing consumer concerns about range anxiety. Many countries have announced plans to phase out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, with ambitious targets for 100% EV adoption by 2035 or earlier. Emission regulations and carbon-neutrality goals are pushing automakers to invest heavily in EV production.
